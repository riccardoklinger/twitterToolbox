# twitterToolbox
A arcpy toolbox for ArcGIS Pro
## installation
Simply grab the pyt file from this git by cloning or downloading the zip and place it in your current project folder.
## advice
I have not tested all possible combinations and this toolbox is far away from being perfect, yet you might want to try it out and provide feedback using the twitter hashtag #twitterToolbox and creating an issue here on git.
This Toolbox is a very lean approach and is not comparable with a [geoevent server](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/geoevent-server)
## contribution
Feel free to commit changes and develop this twitterToolbox to a new level.
